# Unhandled Asynchronous Errors in Node.js Express.js

This repository demonstrates a common error in Node.js Express.js applications where unhandled errors in asynchronous operations lead to silent failures. The server logs the error, but the client receives no indication of the problem.

## Problem
The `bug.js` file contains an Express.js application with an asynchronous operation that might throw an error.  The error handling only logs the error to the console, leaving the client unaware of the failure.  This results in a bad user experience, with the client seemingly hanging.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file demonstrates how to properly handle asynchronous errors in Express.js.  It sends an appropriate error response to the client in case of an error, preventing silent failures and improving the user experience.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the repository's directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install the required packages.
4. Run `node bug.js` to observe the problematic behavior.
5. Run `node bugSolution.js` to see the improved error handling.
